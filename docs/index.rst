Welcome to nrtk-jatic's documentation!
======================================
This is an extension of the Natural Robustness Toolkit (NRTK) for JATIC. This documentation will only contain
information exclusive to the JATIC extention of NRTK. Documentation for NRTK can be found
`here <https://nrtk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

NOTE
----
The ``nrtk-jatic`` package is deprecated and will soon be scheduled for deletion.
All functionality has been integrated into the core `NRTK package <https://gitlab.jatic.net/jatic/kitware/nrtk>`_
under the ``nrtk.interop.maite`` module.
Please switch to using this in the near future.
