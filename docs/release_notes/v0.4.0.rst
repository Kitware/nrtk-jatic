v0.4.0
======

Fixed the ``JATICClassificationAugmentation`` to use proper channels-first ordering. Dropped
the older version of ``nrtk`` in order to simplify it's dependency chain when ``pybsm``
dropped the need for ``opencv``.

Updates / New Features
----------------------

Documentation

* Added T&E guide for NRTK brightness perturbations.

Fixes
-----

* ``JATICClassificationAugmentation`` now expects channels-first input and properly returns channels-first output as
  specified by the MAITE protocols.
